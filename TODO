    Old cruft will be deleted from the project. Vision libs will be
    maintained separately. AI libs will be maintained in a new project.
    
    Main goal of project is now to create a linux-based robot daemon that 
    can run and intercept:
    
    * Keyboard
    * Joypad (with PS3, maybe XBox profiles)
    
    Commands will then be issued through the daemon to the robot.
    As I continue to work, I want the following:
    
    * dbus-based control
    * local wifi-based and/or remote internet-based control of the robot
    * shared memory-based control
    
    Further longterm hardware plans:
    
    * Support various robot hardware
    * Support arduino (various versions)
    * Support query of multiple sensors to help localization.
