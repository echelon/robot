==== About ====

This is a Linux-based C++ program designed to work with the Robotics 
Connection Serializer hardware, but it could easily be adapted to work with the
Arudino, or any other robotics hardware. 

The main program controls the robot hardware and intercepts input from a variety
of sources:

	* Keyboard
	* Joystick (eg. PS3 or Xbox controllers)
	* A remote PC (over TCP) -- currently a work in progress

By keeping hardware concerns apart from AI code, we can easily and separately 
maintain a distinct set of computer vision/AI applications that communicate with
this program in order to drive the robot.

I'll likely upgrade the code to work with Arudino in the near future.
